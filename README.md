# Account Management System

This project contains a simple implementation of an `Account` class representing a bank account. The class includes functions to set and get the account holder's name, set and get the account balance, and methods for deposits and withdrawals.

## Features

- **Instance Variables**:
    - `name`: The account holder's name.
    - `balance`: The account balance.

- **Constructors**:
    - `Account()`: Sets `balance` to 0.
    - `Account(String name)`: Sets `name` and `balance` to 0.
    - `Account(double balance)`: Sets `balance` and `name` to an empty string.
    - `Account(String name, double balance)`: Sets both `name` and `balance`.

- **Methods**:
    - `deposit(double amount)`: Increases the balance by the specified amount.
    - `withdraw(double amount)`: Decreases the balance by the specified amount if sufficient funds are available.
    - `getName()`: Returns the account holder's name.
    - `setName(String name)`: Sets the account holder's name.
    - `getBalance()`: Returns the account balance.
    - `toString()`: Returns a string with the account holder's name and balance.
